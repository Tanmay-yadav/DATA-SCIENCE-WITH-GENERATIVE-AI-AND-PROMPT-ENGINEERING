    "# what are  decorators in python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, decorators are a powerful and convenient way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods without permanently modifying them. They allow for a clean and readable way to extend the functionality of existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Decorators?\n",
    "\n",
    "A decorator is a function that takes another function (or method) as an argument and returns a new function that enhances or modifies the behavior of the original function. Decorators are often used for logging, enforcing access control and permissions, instrumentation, caching, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic example of a decorator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_decorator(func):\n",
    "    def wrapper():\n",
    "        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n",
    "        func()\n",
    "        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n",
    "    return wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "@my_decorator\n",
    "def say_hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "say_hello()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this code, you'll get the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Something is happening before the function is called.\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "Something is happening after the function is called.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@my_decorator` syntax is a shorthand for:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Decorators?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Reusability**: Write a piece of functionality once and apply it across multiple functions.\n",
    "- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep the core logic of your functions clean and separate from auxiliary functionality.\n",
    "- **Readability and Maintainability**: Enhance code readability by separating decoration logic from core logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def log_decorator(func):\n",
    "    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "        print(f\"Function {func.__name__} called with arguments {args} and {kwargs}\")\n",
    "        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "    return wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "@log_decorator\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "add(2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access Control\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def requires_permission(permission):\n",
    "    def decorator(func):\n",
    "        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "            if not user_has_permission(permission):\n",
    "                raise PermissionError(\"You do not have the required permission.\")\n",
    "            return func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "        return wrapper\n",
    "    return decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "@requires_permission('admin')\n",
    "def delete_user(user_id):\n",
    "    print(f\"User {user_id} deleted.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "delete_user(123)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def cache_decorator(func):\n",
    "    cache = {}\n",
    "    def wrapper(*args):\n",
    "        if args in cache:\n",
    "            return cache[args]\n",
    "        result = func(*args)\n",
    "        cache[args] = result\n",
    "        return result\n",
    "    return wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "@cache_decorator\n",
    "def fibonacci(n):\n",
    "    if n < 2:\n",
    "        return n\n",
    "    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(fibonacci(10))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators provide a flexible and elegant way to enhance or modify the behavior of functions and methods in Python. By leveraging decorators, you can keep your codebase clean, modular, and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@` symbol in Python is used to apply a decorator to a function or method. It is a shorthand way of applying a decorator function to another function, making the code more readable and concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Decorators Work\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use the `@decorator` syntax, Python applies the decorator to the function immediately below it. The decorator function takes the original function as an argument and returns a new function that usually extends or alters the behavior of the original function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a detailed example to illustrate how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Timing Function Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to measure the execution time of a function. You can create a decorator to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def timer_decorator(func):\n",
    "    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "        start_time = time.time()\n",
    "        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "        end_time = time.time()\n",
    "        print(f\"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds to execute\")\n",
    "        return result\n",
    "    return wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "@timer_decorator\n",
    "def slow_function():\n",
    "    time.sleep(2)\n",
    "    print(\"Function complete\")\n",
    "\n",
    "slow_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Function complete\n",
    "slow_function took 2.0001 seconds to execute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `timer_decorator` adds timing functionality around the `slow_function` without modifying its core behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "You can apply multiple decorators to a single function. They are applied from the innermost to the outermost:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def decorator1(func):\n",
    "    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "        print(\"Decorator 1\")\n",
    "        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "    return wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "def decorator2(func):\n",
    "    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "        print(\"Decorator 2\")\n",
    "        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "    return wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "@decorator1\n",
    "@decorator2\n",
    "def say_hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "say_hello()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Decorator 1\n",
    "Decorator 2\n",
    "Hello!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decorators with Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to create a decorator that takes arguments, you need to add an extra level of function nesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def repeat(num_times):\n",
    "    def decorator_repeat(func):\n",
    "        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "            for _ in range(num_times):\n",
    "                result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "            return result\n",
    "        return wrapper\n",
    "    return decorator_repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "@repeat(num_times=3)\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello, Alice!\n",
    "Hello, Alice!\n",
    "Hello, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `repeat` is a decorator factory that takes an argument (`num_times`) and returns a decorator that repeats the function call the specified number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `@` decorator syntax in Python provides a clean and expressive way to enhance and modify the behavior of functions and methods. Decorators can be used for a variety of purposes, such as logging, access control, caching, and more, making them a powerful tool in Python programming."
